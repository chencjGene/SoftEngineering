# TextEditor
    a small text editor software using FLTK.
    
# Usage
    compile the TextEditor.cpp file, which need FLTK expansion pack and run. 
    I write it using FLTK 1.1.9. Whether other versions are compatible is still 
    unknow for me. 
    
# Notice 
    The file, copy and paste functions are work well; but cut and search 
    functions are unavailable( there are some bugs when using those functions).
