# SoftEngineering
    An implement of JEPG.
    
# notice
    this *.cpp only contain the core codes of JEPG. Reading the code will help you understand 
    JEPG even it lack some *.h files which contain some unversal functions and  constants.
    I will add those *.h files shortly.    
# notice 
    I upload remaining *.h files today. The codes can be run right now.
# notice
    There are some bugs when you run this code in VS2010. You should caste the parameters 
    of math functions(like sqrt, pow etc) to float or double type(like 2 to 2.0).
    You should add lady.mat, DC.TAB and AC.TAB to the same folder where the code are.
# notice
    I upload the VS2010 version code.
